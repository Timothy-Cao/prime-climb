# prime-climb

I try to make prime climb solver.

So far I have 5 base algorithmic approaches:

1. Random
2. Greedy maximize sum of pawns
3. One pawn rush while other stays around 10 waiting to multiply above 80
4. Both pawns stay around 20 waiting to multiply above 80
5. Both pawns wait around 10 and 20 respectively waiting to multiply above 80

Neural network approach is then applied to first find ideal locations to sit at

Then maybe consider having it decide it's own strategy entirely.
